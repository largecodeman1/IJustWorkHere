## League Of Legends Stat Tracker
* We intend to make a league of legends stat tracker for things important to the game that other sites don't show you. A Crowd control (cc) tracker, gold diff per player, and analysis are just a few functions we intend to add.

## CC tracker
* We want to have a missed/landed CC tracker you can use to see how often you are landing or missing a possibly vital CC (Looking at you Morgana mains). This data will also be used in the analysis function we have. 

## Top Diff? Bot Diff? Jungle Canyon? TRY GOLD DIFF BRONZIE
* The gold difference between players is a big thing in a league of legends game. There's a reason every time teams get baron in pro play the first thing you see pop up is the gold advantage the team with Baron gets. We intend to show you how much gold you are behind or ahead whether it's the CS gap or getting repeatedly solo killed/killing in lane.

## Growth Analysis
* A big ticket feature for this project is the growth analysis. Be seeing what you are doing vs a baseline consisting of pros and one-tricks we can tell you how to improve.
